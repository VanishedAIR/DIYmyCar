              The best way to know if it's time to buy new tires for your
              vehicle is to have them inspected by a professional, but there are
              ways to check them yourself. If you want a precise service
              interval, check your owner's manual or find yours
              <a
                href="https://www.carfax.com/blog/owners-manuals-from-every-brand"
                target="_blank"
                >here.</a

            <li class="when-to-replace-list" style="list-style: circle">
              You can also use the Penny Test to check your tire tread. This
              test can be performed in your own driveway in just a few minutes.
              Here's how it works:
              <ul>
                <li>Place a penny in the tread of your tire.</li>
                <li>
                  Turn the penny so that Lincoln's head points down into the
                  tread.
                </li>
                <li>
                  See if the top of Lincoln's head “disappears.” If it does,
                  your tread is still above 2/32” and you're good to go. If you
                  can see his entire head, it may be time to replace the tire
                  because your tread is no longer deep enough. (see
                  <span class="inline-figure">Fig. 1</span> for example)
                </li>
                <li>
                  Check all four tires, especially in areas that look the most
                  worn. If any parts of your tire fail the penny test, it may be
                  time to replace the tire.
                </li>

          <p>Steps:</p>
          <ol class="steps-list">
            <li>
              If your tire has gone flat on the road, follow the following key
              steps:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  First, <span class="emphasis">look for a safe place</span> to
                  change the tire. Pull off to a quiet side street or a store
                  parking lot and park on a flat section of pavement. Keep alert
                  and aware of your surroundings when exiting your vehicle and
                  during the entire process.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If you are on a busy road or highway when the tire blows out,
                  slowly reduce your speed and look for a safe spot to pull over
                  away from traffic, such as the shoulder of an off-ramp.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If there is no exit nearby, locate a long straight section of
                  the highway and pull over in the emergency lane or on the
                  shoulder of the road, as far away from traffic as you can.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Make Yourself Seen, In Case Of an Emergency
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Turn on your hazard lights as you bring your vehicle to a
                  stop. If it is evening or late night, try to find a well-lit
                  area and turn on the dome light inside your car.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Put the car in park and engage the parking brake to keep the
                  car from rolling. If you have wheel chocks or wheel wedges in
                  your tools to change a tire, place them firmly against both
                  wheels opposite the flat one. If you do not have wheel chocks
                  or wedges in your tool kit, use a couple of bricks or large
                  stones to keep the car immobile.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Gather the tools mentioned earlier
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Set out the tools to change a tire in a place where you can
                  easily and safely get to it. The car jack and lug wrench
                  should be the closest within reach.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Loosen the Lug Nuts.
              <ul>
                <li>
                  One of the key steps to change a tire properly is to prepare
                  the flat for removal while the car is still on the road. This
                  keeps the tire stable and makes it easier to remove.
                </li>
                <li>Remove the wheel cover if your vehicle has one.</li>
                <li>
                  Use the lug wrench or torque wrench to turn the lug nuts
                  counterclockwise. (see
                  <span class="inline-figure">Fig. 2</span> for example)
                </li>
                <li>Loosen the lug nuts but do not remove them.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>

                  in the section on tools to change a tire for the proper
                  placement of the jack and how to operate it.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Place the jack under the vehicle frame next to the flat tire.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Raise the car with the jack until the flat tire has a 6-inch
                  clearance from the ground.
                  <span class="emphasis">Do not</span> place any part of your
                  body under the car while you are changing the tire. (see

                  Remove the lug nuts and place them together in a safe place.
                  The floor of the front seat or inside the door pocket is a
                  good place to keep them while you work.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Take hold of the flat tire with both hands and pull it towards
                  you until it slides off the hub. Set the flat tire aside.

                  Line up the spare tire with wheel bolts and push it into
                  place.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Replace each lug nut, turning them clockwise to tighten.
                  Tighten the nuts in a star pattern — move to the next nut
                  across, rather than the one adjacent — to be sure the wheel
                  mounts evenly. (see
                  <span class="inline-figure">Fig. 4</span> for example)
                </li>
                <li>
                  Turn the lug wrench one final time to be sure the tire is
                  secure, but do not completely tighten all the bolts while the
                  tire is in the air.

                  Use the lug wrench to tighten the nuts, following the same

                  body weight to be sure the lug nuts are very tight. (see

                  environment before getting out of the car. If the area you are
                  in doesn't appear to be safe, or you are unable to safely

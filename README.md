This is a user-friendly website that serves the purpose of guiding users through repairing/working on the little things that typically cost a lot if they were to go to a mechanic. 
It provides a comprehensive step-by-step guide with pictures from various sources to help users better. This is a straightforward website that uses only HTML, CSS, and a little bit of JS. 
I built this website on my own after learning all 3 languages from YouTube.

Improvements are possible, such as reducing HTML complexity or enhancing the visual appeal for a cleaner look.
